# Dark-Mode-Script-Machine

These scripts are for use with tampermonkey, and may or may not work with other script injection addons for chomre, firefox, etc. 
To use them, just download tampermonkey 

For google chrome users - <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en>
For firefox users - <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/>

After installing tampermonkey, just create a new script and copy paste the code for the script you want. Alternatively, you can locate my scripts on OpenUser.JS.
